# Contributing
Found a sound effect annoying or think it belongs elsewhere? Pull requests welcome!

1. All sound effects were pulled from [here](http://www.noproblo.dayjo.org/ZeldaSounds/)

2. Files must be in the **`.ogg`** or **`.oga`** format. Converters exist online and many CLI tools exist elsewhere.

3. Sounds must be named after event your are specifying a change to, such as **`bell.oga`**.

# Special Thanks
Special thanks to [HelpTheWretched](http://www.noproblo.dayjo.org/ZeldaSounds/) providing the sound effects hosted on their website.
